                <p class='subheadtxt'>Let's start with the Demat account in full form; Dematerialised Account, yes! That's the <a href='https://choiceindia.com/blog/demat-account-full-form/' class='linking'> full form of Demat account.</a></p>
                <p class='subheadtxt'>If you are looking to open a Demat account, you first need to understand what a Demat account is? A Demat account allows holding shares and securities in electronic form. </p>
                <p class='subheadtxt'>A Demat account allows the investors to buy and hold shares in it; not only this, a Demat account holds all investments made by an individual in shares, ETFs, government securities and mutual funds in one place. 
                  The Indian Stock market went through a digitisation process through Demat and enforced better and enhanced governance by SEBI. Moreover, the Demat Account reduces the risk of storing, damage, theft, and malpractices by storing securities in electronic format. </p>
                <p class='subheadtxt'> Earlier, the account opening process was manual, and it took ages to get the account activated, but now anyone can open a Demat Account within 5 minutes. Even the pandemic worked as a catalyst, and many people got involved in share trading.  </p>
                <p class='subheadtxt'> Let's understand this better.</p>

                <h3 class="subhead">What is Dematerialisation?</h3>
                <p class='subheadtxt'>Converting physical share certificates into an electronic form is the process known as <a href='https://choiceindia.com/blog/dematerialisation/' class='linking'> Dematerialisation</a>. Dematerialisation makes shares accessible anywhere throughout the world. </p>
                <p class='subheadtxt'>Any person who wants to invest in trade online must open a Demat account with a Depository Participant (DP). The whole concept of Dematerialisation is to eliminate physical share certificates and facilitate a seamless tracking and monitoring of holdings.</p>
                <p class='subheadtxt'> Long back, the share certificate issuance process was cumbersome and time-consuming. Still, Demat has transformed and sped up the entire process and helped store security certificates digitally. </p>
                <p class='subheadtxt'>Post your <a href='https://choiceindia.com/blog/demat-account-activation-time/' class='linking'> Demat account activation</a> and your paper certificates digitally by submitting all your physical securities through a Dematerialisation Request Form (DRF). Also, deface each physical certificate by mentioning "Surrendered for Dematerialisation" on it. Post that, you will get an acknowledgement slip when you surrender your share certificates.

                <h3 class='subhead'>How Does a Demat Account Work?</h3>
                <p class='subheadtxt'>Every stock broker charges a Demat Account opening charges for the services rendered and the maintenance of the account throughout life. </p>
                <p class='subheadtxt'><a href='https://choiceindia.com/blog/how-demat-account-works/' class='linking'> Demat accounts work</a> just like a bank account. For a Demat account to work to its fullest potential, you need to link it with a trading account. Your DP (Depository Participant) puts the investors' buy order forwards to the stock exchange whenever you buy a company's shares through any trading platform.</p>
                <p class='subheadtxt'> After that, the exchange matches the investor's 'buy' request with another investor or trader's corresponding 'sell' request. Once the order matches, an order from the stock exchange is sent to a clearance house, settling the trade.</p>
                <p class='subheadtxt'>   After the transaction is settled, the number of shares investors have bought is credited to their Demat Account by the trading day's end. Likewise, the Demat account of the seller is debited for the number of shares that were sold.</p>

               <div>
                <h3 class='subhead'>Trading and Savings Account: The Integrated Approach!</h3>
                <p class='subheadtxt'>Without a trading account, you can't do anything with your Demat account. You'll have to <a href='https://choiceindia.com/open-trading-account' class='linking'>open a trading account </a> to invest. A trading account helps complete the monetary transactions involved in buying and selling the shares. </p>
                <p class='subheadtxt'>Demat, Trading and Savings accounts are interlinked but work separately for a smooth trading process. The foremost step for opening a Demat account is to have a savings bank account. Moreover, the Demat account holds the security bought while the savings account funds the transaction.</p>
                <p class='note'> Note: A trading account is imperative if you want to invest or trade. Presently, most brokers open a trading account along with a Demat account.</p>

                <ul class='bullet'>
                  <li>
                    <h4 class='listhead'>Safety and security</h4>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'>The safety offered by a Demat account is the greatest advantage. When financial assets used to be held in physical form, it was at risk of getting lost or stolen.</p>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'> The investor would then have to go through paperwork and operational challenges to recover those assets, and still, there would never be any guarantee of recovery.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4 class='listhead'>Faster and smoother settlements</h4>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'>Before the Demat account, it used to take around 14 days because of the physical movement of physical shares from the seller and then to the RTA and finally to the buyer.</p>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'> Now, with the help of the Demat account, the settlement cycle has come down to T+2 days, saving the investors time, effort, and energy</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4 class='listhead'>Reduction in errors</h4>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'>Earlier, due to a lot of manual processes, there were a lot of errors as well. These are often called 'Vanda' trades or error trades. With everything being digital now, these erroneous trades have reduced significantly.</p>
                    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4 class='listhead'>Easy transmission</h4>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'>Since the shares are in electronic form, in case of the death of a Demat account holder, the ownership of the assets held in the Demat account can be easily transferred to the next of kin.</p>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'> However, this is only possible by opening a joint Demat account or adding the next of kin as a nominee. Also, this is not possible when shares are held physically, and the legal heir had to go through too many procedures to claim rights on the financial assets of the deceased Demat account holder.</p>
                    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4 class='listhead'>Better liquidity</h4>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'>Easy transfer is one of the Demat account's greatest advantages because it facilitates easy liquidation of assets. You can easily, i.e., sell or take a loan against shares, mutual funds, etc., if you are holding these financial assets in a Demat account.</p>
                    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4 class='listhead'>Elimination of Odd-lot problems</h4>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'>Demat account has solved the odd-lot problem. Earlier, physical shares were sold in lots, but you can buy and sell even just one share with Demat accounts.</p>
                    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p class='listhead'>One storage for all assets</p>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'>A Demat account stores all your financial assets, including bonds, debentures, ETFs, unit-linked insurance policies etc. Therefore, the Demat account holds assets under one roof making maintenance and tracking easy.</p>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'> It also helps when it comes to filing taxes as you have all your records maintained in one place.</p>

                <ul class='bullet'>
                  <li>
                   
                    <p class='subheadtxt'> SEBI has mandated a complete process of opening a Demat Account that the service provider must follow. However, service providers have the liberty to a certain extent. For instance, anyone can open a Demat Account through the e-KYC account opening by authenticating their Aadhar data. </p>
                    <p class='subheadtxt paraspace'> In e-KYC, the time to trade must be less than 2 days, whereas, in a physical account opening, the trading time should be less than 5 days.</p>

You need to figure out which trading company or broker you want to open your Demat account with. You need to bargain with a broker for trading, whereas if you are an investor, it is highly unlikely your broker will reduce brokerage. Moreover, brokers earn from frequency (the number of times an investor trades).</p>
                    
                  </li>

                   <li> <p class='subheadtxt'>An amount is charged when a debit from the investor's Demat account. Also, there are costs charged if you request a physical transaction copy or a physical copy of the Demat holdings.</p>

                    <p class='subheadtxt'> Any Demat account that is inactive and does not see any transactions for several months becomes dormant. However, the stockbroker or DP is legally liable to manage the Demat account for the investor's safety and keep track of whether the investor purchases or sells any share. </p>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'>Therefore, for the services rendered to maintain the Demat account, the stockbroker charges the investors. The maintenance charges are called Annual Maintenance Charges, and the investor has to pay even in the case of no trading. </p>
                    <p class='subheadtxt'>Moreover, dormant Demat accounts are like a jackpot for scammers who engage in the process of front running. They illegally gain access to inactive or dormant Demat accounts to buy and sell securities based on insider trading to make sure their Demat account is not visible in the scam. </p>
