                                <span className="read-more-wrap "> The stock market is an old establishment that has existed since 1875 when BSE 	was the first the first-ever stock market to be established in Asia, it is evident that in these 147 years of history a lot has changed and one among those changes was the transition of physical paper certificates shares to shares being traded on an online platform

                                    <span className="read-more-target"> This was possible only when in 1996 electronic trading was introduced to the market and since then a Demat account has been the mandatory part of anyone’s investing journey. So let’s now dig deeper into this and understand;<br /><br /><br />

                                        <h2 className="font-bold">What is a Demat Account?</h2>
                                        If we put it into simple terms we can say that the Demat account is a depository where you can safely store your investments in different forms. A Demat account can not only hold your stocks but can also hold your mutual funds, bonds and ETFs.<br /><br />

                                        Demat account is your safe locker as you don’t live in perpetual fear of losing any shares or investments, the whole process is electronic and you’re away from all kinds of triggers that could force you to make irrational decisions.<br /><br /><br />
                                        <h2 className="font-bold">Why Demat Account is Necessary for Investing?</h2>
                                        As mentioned previously, before electronic trading was introduced into the stock market in 1996 people stored their shares as certificates which were in form of physical paper and due to human errors, it is not assured that those physically held shares are in safe hands,<br /><br />

                                        Therefore keeping convenience in mind, the whole process of trading took an electronic route and since then this trend has followed and it was made mandatory for any investor to open a Demat account to participate in the stock market.<br /><br /><br />

                                        <h2 className="font-bold">Difference Between Demat and Trading Account</h2>
                                        Now that we’ve explored what is a Demat account and how it helps us, let's further dive in and understand, how does a <a href=" <?php echo base_url(); ?>open-trading-account">Trading Account</a> play a role here? <br /><br />

                                        In the Stock Market, it is evident that we’ll have a lot of transactions going around and to make these transactions we need to have a trading account, now many might argue shouldn’t the Demat account itself should do that job?<br /><br />

                                        Well to answer that question people need to understand that a Demat account is just a repository where your stocks are stored, for transactional purposes in the stock market you need a trading account.<br /><br />

                                        Now that we've understood how does a <a href="<?php echo CHOICE_INDIA; ?>/blog/difference-between-demat-and-trading-account/">Demat account and a trading account differ</a> from each other, let's look into the details; <br /><br />
                                        <div className="ml-3">
                                            <h3 className="font-bold"> 1. Delivery </h3>
                                            A Demat account stores your stocks only when you take the delivery for it, you can further buy or sell in the future whereas your trading account facilitates you for your intraday activities, in intraday trading, you are required to sell off your positions by the end of the day, hence the intraday trades you’ve taken are not delivered to your Demat account.<br /><br />
                                            <h3 className="font-bold"> 2. Bank Link</h3>
                                            As mentioned before a trading account helps you with transactions, so it makes sense that your trading account and your bank account are both linked to each other so that you can make transactions seamlessly.<br />

                                            When you add money into your trading account you can go ahead and buy stocks that will be stored in your Demat account and if you sell your stocks, your Demat account will get rid of those stocks and the money will be deposited into your trading account and from there it will be transferred to your bank account as per your convenience.

                                        <h3 className="font-bold">Benefits of Opening Demat Account </h3>
                                        In the above-mentioned sections we have told you why is a Demat account necessary but told very less on why exactly is a Demat account beneficial for you,<br />
                                        <div className="ml-3">
                                            <h3 className="font-bold"> 1. Corporate Benefits </h3>
                                            Stocks as a single entity is not only associated with trading, when you buy into a stock you are exposed or eligible to tons of corporate benefits like stock splits, bonuses, dividend payouts etc<br /><br />

                                            Managing all these benefits means your stocks are dynamic, they can change in number when you get a bonus or a stock split. When you are eligible for a dividend payout, the dividends are directly transferred to your bank account.<br />
                                            All these happen seamlessly, but that wouldn’t be the case if it weren't for the Demat account.<br />
                                            <h3 className="font-bold"> 2. Nomination Facilities</h3>
                                            When you open a Demat account for yourself you are required to add a nominee for precautionary measures, the transfer of assets between you and your nominee happens without any hassle, requiring you to have little to no paperwork.<br />
                                            <h3 className="font-bold"> 3. Physical Limitations</h3>
                                            Electronic trading was introduced in 1994, before that we had people trading via physical means using paper certificates. This came with a lot of drawbacks including misplacing stocks, theft, damage to the certificates, etc<br /><br />
                                            With a Demat account, all these problems are tackled altogether, a Demat account provides all the securities that would be required with password authentication.<br />
                                            <h3 className="font-bold"> 4. Versatile Options</h3>
                                            Talking in terms of finance we usually see most of the instruments involved in it are limited to a few folks who check out the rigid structure of authentication and security, but that problem is tackled by Demat accounts without compromising security or authentication. <br /><br />
                                            While opening a Demat account you are provided with plenty options from which you can open your Demat account;
                                            <ul>
                                                <li className="font-bold">Individual Demat Account </li>
                                                Individual Demat account is a fairly simple one and the name itself is explanatory. It is a Demat account dedicated to an individual who operates it themselves.<br />
                                                <li className="font-bold">Minor Demat Account </li>
                                                For the most part, usually, minors or people aged below 18 are not allowed to be engaging in a financial agreement, but, we have certain provisions in place which would allow a minor to have a Demat account.<br />
                                                However, this<a href=" <?php echo base_url(); ?>minor-demat-account"> minor Demat account</a> needs to be operated under the guidance of the minor’s parent or guardian, meaning the minor himself cannot buy or sell shares.<br />
                                                Once the account holder is aged above 18 and wishes to take control of their Demat account, they can do so legally.<br />
                                                <li className="font-bold"><a href=" <?php echo base_url(); ?>nri-demat-account">NRI Demat Account</a></li>
                                                We understand and we know that any legal Indian can possess equities to buy and sell according to their free will, but, what about NRIs?<br />
                                                NRI’s or Non-Resident Indians, do they have the provisions to enjoy the tremendous growth shown by the Indian markets?<br />
                                                Turns out, they do have the provisions to participate in the Indian markets. NRIs are allowed to have Demat accounts but while abiding by the rules of FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act)<br />
                                                <li className="font-bold">Corporate Demat Account</li>
                                                Demat accounts are not only limited to personal use, there are provisions for the corporate companies to invest as a single entity. <a href=" <?php echo base_url(); ?>corporate-demat-account">Corporate Demat accounts</a> are especially special because it reduces the paperwork significantly while you are buying, selling, trading and transferring securities.<br />
                                            </ul>
                                        </div><br />
                                        Now that we’ve covered and also understand what is Demat and how Demat is necessary for us to invest in securities in India, now let’s look at how to do we set up or open a Demat account online.<br /><br /><br />

                                        This is the most common type and is available for majority of the Indian citizens residing in India.<br /><br />

                                            Now you might find it common that institutions open Demat accounts for you for free or at a very nominal price. <br />

                                            Safety charges or account custodian charge fees are usually levied on the DP by the depository, these are one-time charges on the DPs. The DPs who charge safety charges on their customers do it on a monthly basis.<br />
                                            <li className="font-bold">Annual Maintainance Charge (AMC)</li>
                                            Annual Maintainance charges are levied on the investor by the DP for the services they provide. <br />
                                            The annual Maintainance charge is also called the folio maintenance charge, these charges range between 200 - 1000 rupees per annum.
