                            <p>Options trading is one of the most investor-friendly methods available, with the flexibility to pay premiums and leverage the position of the underlying security in the future. But it can be challenging to track and understand the performance of an options contract unless you rely on the NSE option chain.</p>
                            <p>With the option chain, NSE aims to provide information about the present value of securities and an estimate of their future performance. It is a valuable tool for performing analysis and picking contracts that display signs of performing better.</p>
                            <p>But before delving into the concept, it is essential to understand the core concept of the option chain and how it can help you make calculative decisions during options trading.</p>
                            <h3 className='seo-h3'>What is NSE Option Chain?</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Asking price</li>
                                <li>Asking quantity</li>
                                <li>Real-time bid price</li>
                                <li>Price at which trades were executed</li>
                                <li>Bid quantity</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You gain a fair idea of the price movements to help with your research. It also provides insights into different points or instances where low or high liquidity levels are achieved.</p>
                           <h3 className='seo-h3'>How to Check & Open NSE Option Chain?</h3>
                            <p>The NSE option chain is publicly available on the official website of the National Stock Exchange. As soon as you visit the website, you can access it using the following steps:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Spot the search bar on top of the page</li>
                                <li>Search ‘Nifty’ in the search bar and click on the first option that says ‘Nifty derivatives’</li>
                                <li>You will be redirected to a page with general information about Nifty</li>
                                <li>Scroll to ‘contract information' and click on ‘option chain’</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Immediately, you will be presented with a table that comprises information about stock contracts, with the option to sort them using various filters.</p>
                            <h3 className='seo-h3'>How to Read the NSE Option Chain?</h3>
                            <p>When you first visit the NSE India option chain page, you will be greeted with various options, allowing you to filter the options contracts according to the type of Nifty, company, expiry date and strike price.</p>
                            <p>Following these filters is a dynamic option called ‘underlying index’ which tells you when the information was last updated. Next comes the table, comprising the following fields:</p>
                            <h4 className='seo-h4'>Strike Price</h4>
                            <p>Options contracts occur between a buyer and a seller. In this context, the strike price is the amount at which both these parties agree to execute the contract. If the price of the options contracts exceeds the initial strike price, the trade is profitable for the buyer.</p>
                            <h4 className='seo-h4'>Implied Volatility (IV)</h4>
                            <p>As the name suggests, implied volatility provides an estimate of the extent of the price swing of a specific options contract. It gives information about the volatility of price change. High IV equates to more volatile price swings, while low IV points to minimal fluctuations.</p>
                            <h4 className='seo-h4'>Open Interest (OI)</h4>
                            <p>The value of open interest signifies the interest towards the options contract when it is at a specific strike price. A high value of OI in the NSE live option chart means it has significant attention and interest in the market.</p>
                            <h4 className='seo-h4'>Volume</h4>
                            <p>The volume of a contract represents the amount of interest it has accrued in the market. It is calculated by analysing the total number of contracts executed for a specific price in the market. This metric is updated daily and gives traders an overview of the demand for each option contract.</p>
                            <h4 className='seo-h4'>Last Traded Option (LTP)</h4>
                            <p>The latest price at which an options trade was executed dictates the LTP value in the NSE chain option.</p>
                            <p>The other fields mentioned in the option chain data of NSE are self-explanatory. For instance, the bid price is the last value for purchasing a specific options contract. And bid quantity refers to the number of orders quoted for a contract at a particular strike price.</p>
                            <h3 className='seo-h3'>Is the NSE Option Chain Beneficial for You?</h3>
                            <p>As it stands, options contracts are subject to volatility and fluctuations. It can be challenging to keep track of these changes manually. With the option chain, NSE India aims to automate this process by offering a look into the performance of these contracts and making it easier for you to make data-backed purchase decisions.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, here are some benefits you stand to gain with the NSE option chain data:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Helps you figure out the expiry date of each contract</li>
                                <li>Alerts you about potential breakouts in the index</li>
                                <li>Gives a view of strike prices across all contracts to aid better investment decisions</li>
                                <li>Provides an in-depth view into the liquidity and depth of option contracts</li>
                            </ul>
