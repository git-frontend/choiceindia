It acts as an intermediary between the investors and the stock market to ensure smooth and paperless transactions between them.

                content: `A Demat account functions as the digital vault for your securities. It allows you to buy, hold, and sell shares with ease, regardless of your location. However, it doesn't operate in isolation. Here's how it collaborates with other elements to offer seamless transactions:</p>
                                <p><strong>Account opening -</strong>  Stock brokers help you open a Demat account and in return they charge some fees in order to maintain the same. <br /><br />
                                <strong>Link it with a trading account -</strong> In order to carry out your trading activities, you need to link your demat account with a trading account. Now-a-days opening a trading account doesn’t require any individual process as brokers open it alongside while one opens a demat account and hence they are already linked to each other.
                                <br /><br />
                                <strong>Order placement -</strong>  Your Depository Participant (DP) forwards your buy orders to the stock exchange when you make purchases via a trading platform.
                                <br/><br/>
                                <strong>Settlement -</strong> Once your buy order matches with a corresponding sell order, the stock exchange sends it to a clearinghouse for settlement. At the end of the trading day, the shares you've bought are credited to your Demat account. Similarly, the seller's Demat account is debited for the sold shares.
                                <br/><br/>
                                    Remember, without a trading account, you cannot utilize your Demat account for investments. A trading account handles the monetary transactions associated with buying and selling shares.
