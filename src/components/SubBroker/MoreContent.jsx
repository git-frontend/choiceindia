                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">As many working professionals are interested in starting stock investment, being a sub broker can be a great career option. You can help these customers get into the stock market and begin investing.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">For this, you have to work with established stock brokers to help expand their business.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Whether you want to be a sub broker or require their services, this article will walk you through all the details. Let’s begin exactly who is the sub broker?</p>

                                    <h3>What is a Sub Broker?</h3>
                                        <p className="sml-para-dv">To understand <a href="https://choiceindia.com/blog/sub-broker-meaning/">what is a sub broker</a>, it’s essential to know how they work</p>
                                        <p className="sml-para-dv">A sub broker is not a trading member of a stock exchange. Instead, these professionals will work on behalf of a stock broker. They will promote and sell the services of this stock broker to interested customers and clients.</p>
                                        <p className="sml-para-dv">So, sub brokers will not have unique services but will connect customers to the stock broker. They will help customers with paperwork, payment and making smarter investment decisions.</p>
                                        <p className="sml-para-dv">According to the number of clients the stock broker receives, they will pay the sub brokers a fixed commission. The agreement document between the sub broker and the broker will specify the earnings and associated formalities.</p>
                                      

                                    <h3>How to Start Sub Broker Franchise?</h3>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">To start a sub broker franchise, you must partner with a well-known stock brokerage company. Your objective will be to sell products on behalf of this company to your customers.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">You need to be a SEBI registered sub broker and have cleared the associated exams to begin this franchise. Then, you have to submit the required documents like identity proof and educational certificates.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">The franchise will be functional after you make the required initial payments.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Sub Broker Business Model</h3>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">The <a href="https://choiceindia.com/blog/sub-broker-business-model">sub broker business model</a> has two primary members - the stock brokerage firm and the sub broker professional.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">The broker provides training, support and assistance to the sub broker to deal with clients. In return, the sub broker brings customers to the broker for them to purchase the broker's services and products.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">With every product purchase and financial transaction, the broker will pay a certain amount to the sub broker.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">All the partnership terms will be discussed before the sub broker and broker join forces. In general, the stockbroker decides the terms of the partnership.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">In addition to the sub broker business model, brokerage firms also provide <a href="https://choiceindia.com/authorised-person">Authorised Person</a>, for whom SEBI registration is required, and <a href="https://choiceindia.com/remisier">Remisier</a> , who can function in the same capacity but does not need to register with SEBI and does not require an initial deposit. However, Remisier will get less brokerage sharing than a sub broker or an Authorised Person.</p>

                                    <h3>How Does A Sub Broker Franchise Work?</h3>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">In any sub broker franchise, the sub broker acquires clients, or the broker provides them with their customers. Then, the franchise offers complete support to improve the customer's investments.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">If the customer has queries, they will ask the sub broker, who might direct those to the stock broker for clarification.</p>

                                    <h3>Sub Broker Franchise Cost</h3>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">The <a href="https://choiceindia.com/blog/sub-broker-franchise-cost">sub broker franchise cost</a> can range anywhere between INR 50,000 and 3,00,000. Interested franchisees may need to pay a security deposit to the franchisor. A portion of the initial deposit might be refundable, but it will purely depend upon the franchisor or broker.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">However, the payment terms might vary according to the stock broker.</p>

                                    <h3><a href="https://choiceindia.com/blog/how-much-does-a-sub-broker-earns-in-india/">How Much a Sub Broker Earns in India?</a></h3>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">A sub broker earns through a fixed commission rate decided beforehand with the stock broker. This amount will depend upon the customer's purchase and associated financial transactions. In short, the better the trade, the more the earnings will be for the sub broker.</p>
                              
                                    <h3>Sub Broker Commission</h3>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">The sub broker commission might be between 40% and 80% of the total business transaction amount. Moreover, the commission rate can be high if the stock broker is reputed and has a flourishing business.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">If the broker follows a lump sum payment model, the sub broker will receive a fixed amount on every construction. On the other hand, if the broker chooses a percentage-based model, then the sub broker gets a pre-decided percentage of the transaction as a commission.</p>
                              
                                    <h3>Start a Sub Brokership without Deposit with Choice</h3>

                                    <h4>Responsibilities of Brokers</h4>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Brokers handle multiple investment deals, including mutual funds, securities and commodities. They offer investment advice and assistance to their clients.</p>

                                    <h4>Responsibilities of Sub Brokers</h4>
