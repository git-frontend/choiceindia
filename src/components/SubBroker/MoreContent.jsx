                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">A Sub Broker is an individual who works on behalf of a stock broking firm. The primary <a href="https://choiceindia.com/blog/role-of-broker-and-sub-broker-in-capital-market/">role of a Sub broker</a> is to serve as a link between a Broker and client. As a Sub broker works closely with a Stockbroker, one of their key responsibilities is to acquire new clients for the  brokerage firm.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">He/she should assist the clients to invest in shares and manage the client’s portfolio. He/she should manage the queries of the client. A Sub broker earns commission from the transactions done by the clients.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has made it mandatory for all Sub brokers to receive a Certificate of Registration. Without the certificate, the individual won’t be able to deal in shares and securities with any clients. So a client must ensure that the individual is registered with SEBI as an authorized Sub broker.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>What Are The Benefits of Being A Sub Broker?</h3>
                                    <ul className="terms-list sml-para-dv">
                                            <li>Being a Sub broker can help to gain expertise and knowledge of the financial market. As Sub brokers get access to stock-related information from the stock broking franchise, they can use the knowledge to improve their market knowledge and serve their clients better.</li>
                                            <li>Thirdly, an individual can become a Sub broker without making a large amount of investment. Many share broking franchises allow you to start a career as a sub-broker at a small amount of investment, say at a minimum of Rs 10,000.</li>
                                            <li>The Sub broker franchise in which you operate as a sub-broker also allows you to offer services other than investment advice and portfolio handling of the clients. Some brokers encourage them to sell mutual funds and loan services to clients.</li>
                                        
                                    </ul>

                                    <h3>How Does A Sub Broker Franchise Work?</h3>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">A Sub broker franchise works under a reputed broking house. The first step involves registering the franchise under SEBI. Once it is legalized, the franchise is responsible for gaining as many clients as possible to earn revenue from the <a href="https://choiceindia.com/">brokerage firm</a>. An excellent client base is a key to higher income for the stockbroker.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">The stockbroker is responsible to make sure that the clients acquired by a sub-broker are satisfied with the service and have a profit-bearing portfolio. The share broking franchise must follow all the norms in the agreement and adhere to the revenue sharing policy with the brokerage firm.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">It is also important to see that the trades placed by the clients are done at the right prices in the market.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">A sub- broking franchise has to give away a percentage share of the income to the brokerage firm. It is like rent that has to be paid to the broker for using their patent name. The amount charged is usually minimum and all the other income can be retained by the Franchise.</p>
