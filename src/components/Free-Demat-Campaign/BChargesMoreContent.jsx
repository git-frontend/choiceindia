                                This was possible only when in 1996 electronic trading was introduced to the market and since then a Demat account has been the mandatory part of anyone’s investing journey. So let’s now dig deeper into this and understand;</p>

                                    <h3 className="seo-h3">Why Demat Account is Necessary for Investing?</h3>
                                    <p className="seo-para">As mentioned previously, before electronic trading was introduced into the stock market in 1996 people stored their shares as certificates which were in form of physical paper and due to human errors, it is not assured that those physically held shares are in safe hands,</p>
                                    <p className="seo-para">Therefore keeping convenience in mind, the whole process of trading took an electronic route and since then this trend has followed and it was made mandatory for any investor to open a Demat account to participate in the stock market.</p>

                                    <p className="seo-para">In the Stock Market, it is evident that we’ll have a lot of transactions going around and to make these transactions we need to have a trading account, now many might argue shouldn’t the Demat account itself should do that job?</p>
                                    <p className="seo-para">Well to answer that question people need to understand that a Demat account is just a repository where your stocks are stored, for transactional purposes in the stock market you need a trading account.</p>
                                    <p className="seo-para">Now that we've understood how does a <Link to="/blog/difference-between-demat-and-trading-account/">Demat account and a trading account differ</Link> from each other, let's look into the details;</p>

                                    <h4 className="seo-h4"> 1. Delivery </h4>
                                      <p className="seo-para">A Demat account stores your stocks only when you take the delivery for it, you can further buy or sell in the future whereas your trading account facilitates you for your intraday activities, in intraday trading, you are required to sell off your positions by the end of the day, hence the intraday trades you’ve taken are not delivered to your Demat account.</p>
                                    <h4 className="seo-h4"> 2. Bank Link</h4>
                                      <p className="seo-para">As mentioned before a trading account helps you with transactions, so it makes sense that your trading account and your bank account are both linked to each other so that you can make transactions seamlessly.</p>
                                      <p className="seo-para">When you add money into your trading account you can go ahead and buy stocks that will be stored in your Demat account and if you sell your stocks, your Demat account will get rid of those stocks and the money will be deposited into your trading account and from there it will be transferred to your bank account as per your convenience.</p>

                                    <h4 className="seo-h4"> 1. Corporate Benefits </h4>
                                      <p className="seo-para">Stocks as a single entity is not only associated with trading, when you buy into a stock you are exposed or eligible to tons of corporate benefits like stock splits, bonuses, dividend payouts etc.</p>
                                      <p className="seo-para">Managing all these benefits means your stocks are dynamic, they can change in number when you get a bonus or a stock split. When you are eligible for a dividend payout, the dividends are directly transferred to your bank account.</p>
                                      <p className="seo-para">All these happen seamlessly, but that wouldn’t be the case if it weren't for the Demat account.</p>
                                    <h4 className="seo-h4"> 2. Nomination Facilities</h4>
                                      <p className="seo-para">When you open a Demat account for yourself you are required to add a nominee for precautionary measures, the transfer of assets between you and your nominee happens without any hassle, requiring you to have little to no paperwork.</p>

                                      <p className="seo-para">Electronic trading was introduced in 1994, before that we had people trading via physical means using paper certificates. This came with a lot of drawbacks including misplacing stocks, theft, damage to the certificates, etc.</p>
                                      <p className="seo-para">With a Demat account, all these problems are tackled altogether, a Demat account provides all the securities that would be required with password authentication.</p>

                                      <p className="seo-para">Talking in terms of finance we usually see most of the instruments involved in it are limited to a few folks who check out the rigid structure of authentication and security, but that problem is tackled by Demat accounts without compromising security or authentication.</p>
                                      <p className="seo-para">While opening a Demat account you are provided with plenty options from which you can open your Demat account;</p>

                                        <p className="seo-para">Turns out, they do have the provisions to participate in the Indian markets. NRIs are allowed to have Demat accounts but while abiding by the rules of FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act)</p>
