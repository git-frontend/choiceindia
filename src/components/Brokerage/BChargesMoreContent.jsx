                                        <h2 className="font-bold">How are Brokerage Charges Calculated?</h2><br/>
                                        The Brokerage charges are calculated on the traded value. Most brokers charge a percentage on the scale of shares bought or sold by the trader. The share brokerage calculators can be used to calculate the cost for intraday and delivery trading. <br /><br />
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Intraday Trading:</strong></li>
                                            In Intraday trading, a trader buys and sells shares on the same day. The intraday charges for most brokers vary between 0.01% to 0.05%. So, the formula to calculate the <strong>brokerage charges</strong> for a trader here is to: Multiply the number of shares (bought/sold) by the market price of the stocks by the agreed percentage of intraday charges.<br/><br/>
                                            For Choice, the agreed percentage is 0.02% for intraday traders.<br/><br/>
                                        <li><strong>Delivery Trading:</strong> In Delivery trading, a trader can buy as many stocks they wish to trade and hold them. The delivery charges for most brokers vary between 0.2% to 0.75% of the trading volume. So, the formula to calculate the <strong>brokerage charges</strong> for a trader here is to: Multiply the number of shares (bought) by the market price of the stocks by the agreed percentage of delivery charges.<br/><br/>
                                        For Choice, the agreed percentage is 0.2% for delivery traders.<br/><br/></li>
                                        
                                        </ul>
