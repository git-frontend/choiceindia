                                    <p>Stocks are not the only thing people invest in, trade, and earn money from. If done carefully, commodity markets can give some very promising returns. Commodities, being the building blocks of any economy, are widely traded across the globe.</p>
                                    <p>The <a href="/blog/commodity-trading-meaning/">meaning of commodity trading</a> is the buying and selling of various commodities and their derivative products. Let us break this definition and understand every part of it in detail to make it more lucid.
                                    First, the commodities are traded in bulk. Unlike shares, you cannot buy as many units as you want. Instead, you have to buy the commodities in many multiples of that lot. The prices of these commodities are set according to the market forces of demand and supply.</p>

                                    <p>Organized commodity trading began in India with the setting up of the Bombay Cotton Trade Association in 1875. However, the foundation of the commodities market was laid way before thatâ€”way before any other country. </p>

<p>The Bombay Cotton Exchange was established in 1893, which eventually led to establishing futures markets in edible oilseeds, jute, and other jute products.</p>

<p>So, now that we know the remarkable history of the Indian Commodity Markets, let us dive into what commodity trading is and why there's so much buzz about it these days.</p>
