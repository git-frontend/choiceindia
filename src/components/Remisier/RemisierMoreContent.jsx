        <span className="read-more-wrap "> The stock market is one of the most popular investment avenues, inviting curiosity from several individuals looking to diversify their portfolios. Branching out from fixed deposits or standard bank savings with low-interest rates also helps investors achieve a significant increase in their initial investment, albeit with risks.

        <p>However, trading in the stock market mandates specific prerequisites, one of which is creating a Demat account with a registered stockbroker. Given the number of online stockbrokers in the market, it can take time for investors to figure out the ideal fit for their investment aspirations. Additionally, stockbrokers are not allowed to advertise directly to investors either. </p>
        <p>How do stockbrokers familiarise investors with their services, then?</p>
        <p>Most stockbrokers rely on the services of a middleman, like an <Link to="/authorised-person">authorised person</Link>, <Link to="/sub-broker-franchise">sub broker</Link> or remisier. While the former two are subject to some stringent rules, it is relatively easier to become a remisier in stock market.</p>
                                        <br />
                                        <h3 className='ttl-para'>What is a Remisier?</h3>
                                        <p>Naturally, when you stumble across this term, the first question is - What is remisier?</p>
                                        <p>Think of a remisier as a marketing executive for a particular stockbroker. The primary responsibility of a remisier is to facilitate a connection between potential investors and stockbrokers for a predetermined commission.</p>
                                        <p>Unlike a sub broker or an authorised person, a remisier does not have the authority to represent a stockbroker. The standard <Link to="/blog/what-is-remisier/">remisier meaning</Link> defines them as solicitors or introducers who focus on bridging the gap between clients and brokerage houses.</p>
                                        <p>Their role ends here, and they do not continue building client relationships through investment advice.</p>
        
                                        <br/>
        <h3 className='ttl-para'>The Working of the Remisier Business Model</h3>
        <p>Among all the intermediaries working to connect stockbrokers with potential investors, remisiers enjoy the most independent business model with minimal to no capital expenditure. Owing to the nature of their role, they do not need an initial investment to set up a dedicated office or pay an upfront fee to secure a licence.</p>
        <p>The first step of a successful remisier business model is to partner up with a reputed stockbroker like Choice India. Discussions about predetermined commissions then take place with the stockbroker. After both parties arrive at a mutually beneficial arrangement, the remisier is free to bring as many clients as possible to the stockbroker.</p>
        <p>However, potential investors must be chosen with caution. For one, they must possess a particular risk appetite for the stock market. Secondly, onboarded individuals must have the capital to regularly or periodically invest in the market. The latter is especially important since the commission is decided mainly by the amount invested by the client.</p>
                                        <br/>
                                        <h3 className='ttl-para'>What is the Remisier Commission in India?</h3>
                                        <p>Remisier commission in India varies according to the stockbroker for which these professionals acquire clients. Generally, remisiers earn commissions in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When they successfully direct a client to a stockbroker and convince them to <Link to="/open-free-demat-account">open a Demat account</Link></li>
            <li>When investors trade on the platform.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Combining these factors, it is estimated that the remisier commission in India ranges anywhere from 15% to 30% behind every trade made by their onboarded clients. Certain stockbrokers also have pre-decided slabs that reward stockbrokers with higher commissions if the traded value exceeds a specific value.</p>
                                        <br/>
        <h3 className='ttl-para'>What is the Eligibility to Become a Remisier?</h3>
        <p>The path to becoming a successful remisier starts by pairing up with a reputed stockbroker. Each stockbroker has a set of different prerequisites for the candidate before they are nominated as the remisiers for the broker company.</p>
        <p>The standard eligibility criteria for becoming a remisier in India are as follows.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Experience in marketing, sales or other domains that require constant communication with the clients
            </li>
            <li>Basic knowledge of the stock market and the financial domain to satiate queries of potential investors</li>
            <li>Entrepreneurship spirit with a business mindset to close deals</li>
            <li>At least above 18 years of age with an HSC degree</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While uncommon, certain stockbrokers also filter candidates according to experience in the financial markets.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3 className='ttl-para'>What is the Difference Between Remisiers and Brokers in the Stock Market?</h3>
        <p>The primary point of difference in the <Link to="/blog/broker-vs-remisier/">remisier vs broker</Link> definition is that remisiers are not trading members of the stock exchanges in India. They are only responsible for connecting brokers and potential investors, convincing the latter to open a trading account with the stockbroker.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, stockbrokers act as a medium between investors and trading exchanges. Investors can execute trades pertaining to securities, exchanges or derivatives using a stockbroker or an online stockbroker platform.</p>
        <p>Owing to the difference in their roles, remisiers and brokers are interdependent. Since stockbrokers cannot directly advertise their platform and remisiers cannot ask clients for payments, they band together to form a successful business model.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3 className='ttl-para'>Remisiers vs Sub Brokers</h3>
        <p>In theory, the role of remisiers and sub brokers is to acquire clients for their respective stockbrokers. However, this is the last point of similarity, where the remisier vs sub broker debate begins.</p>
        <p>A sub broker does not merely help onboard clients, but they also offer investment advice and guide the individuals through the fluctuating market movements. Hence, sub brokers are mandated to be aware of the fundamentals of financial markets. Due to these responsibilities, they also earn a higher commission than remisiers.</p>
        <p>Comparatively, remisiers are chosen based on their comfort in interacting with clients. Their primary role is to convince potential investors to <Link to="/open-trading-account">open a trading account</Link> with a particular stockbroker.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3 className='ttl-para'>Who can Become a Remisier?</h3>
        <p>The role of a remisier is not restricted to a particular set of individuals. The only requirement for the role is that you are comfortable with prolonged communication with various clients.</p>
        <p>As long as you are above 18 with an HSC degree, you can apply for the position of remisier, irrespective of your previous field. Connect with a reputed stockbroker like Choice India to earn a fair commission whenever you familiarise a client with the platform.</p>
        <p>The lack of significant initial investment also makes the role of a remisier an attractive option. You can set your business hours and scale your commissions by reaching out to more clients in a day.</p>
        <p>So, analyse and assess the advantages and disadvantages of a role and become a remisier with <Link to="/">Choice India</Link> now!</p>
