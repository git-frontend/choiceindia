                                    Well, then you’re in luck! In this post, we will cover everything about trading accounts, their fees, benefits, and other details. So, without further ado, let’s begin!
                                        <br />
                                        <br />

                                        <h2 className="font-bold">What is a Trading Account?</h2>
                                        If you’re wondering or Googling “trading account is which type of account”?  then you’re at the right place. But before we answer the same, it is important that you understand the <a href="https://choiceindia.com/blog/trading-account-meaning/">trading account meaning.</a>  <br /><br />
                                        You can consider it an investment account containing cash, securities, and other holdings that helps you purchase or sell your assets, like equity shares in the stock market.<br /><br />
                                        In short, a trading account is hence like a bank account that speeds up the process of buying and selling shares. Moreover, you don't have to be physically present at a stock exchange for these financial transactions. <br /> <br />
                                        You just need to open a trading account with a reliable and registered stock broker to get started. The stock broker will guide you in trading shares and handling all the processes. In addition, you will receive a unique ID for conducting the stock market purchases.  <br /> <br />
    
                                        <h2 className="font-bold">Trading Account Fees &amp; Charges</h2> 
                                        Before understanding trading account opening and its basics, you need to understand the associated fees. When you choose Choice for your account, you can open it for free! 
                                        <br /><br />
                                        To elaborate, you can open a free trading account where the annual maintenance charges (AMC) are free for the first year to get you started. Subsequently, from the second year, Choice charges a minimal fee to keep your account functional. 
                                        <br />
                                        Additionally, you can choose from three AMC plans provided by the company - 
                                        <br /><br />
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                            200 INR/- + GST (Yearly Plan) 
                                            </li>
                                            <li>1500 INR/- + GST (Lifetime AMC Coverage Plan) </li>
                                            <li>3000 INR/-Full Refundable AMC Plan (Choice will recount the total AMC amount when you close the account)</li>

                                        <br />
                                        However, the <a href="https://choiceindia.com/blog/trading-account-charges-fees/">trading account charges</a>  vary in trading equity, currency, and commodities<br /><br />

                                        However, if you haven't completed the KYC, it might take a couple of business days to open your trading account.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Here are the documents required for trading account opening with Choice:

                                        </ul>
                                        <br/>
                                        You must also remember to self-attest all these important documents before uploading them to the website. Additionally, apart from these

                                        documents, you also have to provide the POA (power of attorney) to the broker. 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        This is a very important document that you need to fill up and self-attest. 
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Thereafter, you must send it to the Choice headquarters at their official address.
                                        <br/><br/>

                                        <h2 className="font-bold">Difference between Trading Account and Demat Account</h2> <br />
                                        You need to understand the <a href="https://choiceindia.com/blog/difference-between-demat-and-trading-account/">difference between a trading account</a> and <a href="https://choiceindia.com/demat-account">Demat account</a> to expand your wealth in the stock market.<br/><br/>
                                        To answer the same, a Demat account is used for storing the shares you have bought in a digitized format. Acting as a repository, its prime objective is to hold the securities.<br/><br/>
                                        On the other hand, a trading account acts as a platform for selling and buying securities or shares. So, the major financial transactions are a part of this account.
