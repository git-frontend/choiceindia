                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">With rising inflation and expenses disrupting everyday lives, having an alternate source of income can be an excellent choice. <Link to="/mutual-funds-investment">Mutual fund investments</Link> can offer relief by providing a steady growth of your money.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">But to reap the benefits, you must possess a thorough understanding of mutual funds. Fortunately, ample information is available online today to guide the average mutual fund investor.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">However, having a mutual fund distributor by your side can be beneficial, thanks to their significant knowledge and role in the industry. Of course, becoming one yourself grants you the required ability to handle your own assets and also improves your chances of a secondary income.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Now it may seem overwhelming for the uninitiated. But if you are keen on becoming a mutual fund distributor yourself, this article will guide you in your endeavour.</p>
                                    <h3>What Is A Mutual Fund Distributor?</h3>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">A mutual fund distributor is often referred to as a mutual fund agent. This is a person or entity that helps in the buying and selling of mutual fund units. In return, the distributor makes an earning on the upfront or trail commission as they bring in more investors to a particular scheme.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">The distributor also assists in investing by guiding investors regarding the scope and schemes of various fund houses. Their function is authorised by the <a href="https://www.sebi.gov.in/" target={"_blank"}>Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)</a> and is completely safe.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Besides investing in mutual funds, the distributor helps investors execute investment transactions, redemption, and switch between funds. One can even learn about the performance of their investments with the help of the distributor.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Eligibility To Become A Mutual Fund Distributor</h3>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">So, what does it take to become a mutual fund distributor?</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">To begin your career as one or switch your career to this field, it is vital to know the requirements.</p>
                                    <h4>Educational Qualification</h4>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Firstly, you must legally be an adult (above 18) to become a professional in this field. The minimum educational qualification to become a distributor is a class 12 degree. You can also become a fund distributor with a class 10 degree if you have a three years diploma.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Certification</h4>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Each mutual fund distributor must hold a license or certification issued by the National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM).</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Other than that, you must at least complete the <a href="https://www.nism.ac.in/mutual-fund-distributors/" target={"_blank"}>NISM Series V-A: Mutual Fund Distributors Certification</a> successfully to become a certified professional. This has been made compulsory by the governing body SEBI for anyone willing to opt for this profession.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Upon completing the certification examination, you shall receive an ARN (AMFI Registration number) issued by the NISM. This acts as proof of eligibility, giving you the right to buy, market, and sell mutual fund units.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">The ARN number is valid for three years. After which, you can do it from the official website of the regulatory body called Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI).</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Mutual fund distributors can also be non-individual entities, like brokering houses, online distribution, banks, etc. In such cases, the ARN holders shall refer to each organisation’s sales staff with a separate EUIN. These people are also referred to as non-individual RIA (Registered Investment Advisors).</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Note: Even insurance agents can become mutual fund distributors after receiving the ARN number from AMFI.</p>
                                    <h4>Other Requirements</h4>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">You would also need an Employee Unique Identification Number (EUIN) generated. After receiving the ARN, the potential mutual fund distributors must enrol themselves in Asset Management Companies or AMCs.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">These management firms fetch investor money by providing a wide array of assets and use them as capital to benefit the investors. Along with mutual funds, these firms also administer several exchange-traded funds (ETFs), real estate, bond markets, private equity, etc.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">By tying up with the AMCS, mutual fund distributors can offer multiple fund schemes to their clients that may bring easy returns.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Moreover, AMCs offer marketing and training material to guide you to become a better distributor for your investors. And, of course, you receive a commission on every sale you make!</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Special tips: A senior citizen willing to become a mutual fund distributor must attend the <a href="https://www.nism.ac.in/continuing-professional-education-cpe-ecpe/" target={"_blank"}>CPE program</a> training module to apply for the ARN number.</p>
                                    <h3>The Role Of Mutual Fund Distributors</h3>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Due to their active part in the mutual fund industry, mutual fund distributors serve many roles. From analysing various investment opportunities to helping investors diversify their portfolios for better risk management, there is much to be done.</p>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Here are some of the most important responsibilities you must take on as a mutual fund distributor.</p>
                                    <ul className="terms-list sml-para-dv">
                                        <li>
                                            <h4 className="child-ttl">Understanding the Investors’ Financial Goals:</h4>
                                            <p>You must understand the financial goals of your investors and how much time they are willing to afford. Some examples of goals are retirement planning, covering the expense of higher education, and growing their wealth.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>

                                            <p>You must also analyse how much risk the investors are willing to take to reach their goals. For instance, debt funds are less risky than equity but offer lesser returns.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>

                                            <p>You must provide sound financial advice by guiding the investors according to their risk-taking attitude and long and short-term financial goals.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <h4 className="child-ttl">Analysing Investment Opportunities:</h4>
                                            <p>Mutual fund agents must also examine the existing market conditions to develop the best possible portfolio adjustment for the investors.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <h4 className="child-ttl">Devising and Documentation of Investment Strategies:</h4>
                                            <p>Once the above functions are completed, it is time to devise the right strategy for the customer. You will also have to document each handling of the financial details diligently.</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p className="sml-para-dv">Of course, these are just a glimpse, and the actual responsibilities of a mutual fund distributor extend much deeper into the financial planning sector.</p>
