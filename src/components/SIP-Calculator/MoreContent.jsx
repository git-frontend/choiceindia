                            <h3 className='seo-h3'>What is a SIP Calculator?</h3>
                            <p>A SIP calculator is an online tool that helps investors calculate the potential returns on their investments in a SIP. It is a simple and easy-to-use tool that can provide investors with an estimate of the wealth they can accumulate by investing a fixed amount of money regularly over a period of time. The calculator uses complex financial calculations to predict the future value of an investment based on factors such as the invested amount, investment period, and expected rate of return.</p>
                            <h3 className='seo-h3'>How does the SIP calculator work?</h3>
                            <p>The SIP calculator uses a simple formula to calculate the future value of an investment. The formula is based on the compound interest principle, which means that the interest earned on an investment is added to the principal amount, and the interest is then calculated on the new total.</p>
                            <p>The formula used by the SIP calculator is as follows:</p>
                            <p>FV= P Ã— [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r</p>
                            <ul className='list-styl-none mrg-3'>
                                <li>where,</li>
                                <li>FV = Future Value of the investment</li>
                                <li>P = Monthly Investment Amount</li>
                                <li>r = Rate of return per annum/12</li>
                                <li>n = Number of years</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The SIP calculator takes input values from the user such as the invested amount, investment period, and expected rate of return, and then calculates the potential returns on the investment based on the above formula.</p>
